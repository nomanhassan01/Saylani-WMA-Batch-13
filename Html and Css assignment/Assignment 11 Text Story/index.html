            <p class="sub-heading-text">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for
                centuries to herd and to
                protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded
                soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the
                point
                of extiction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas
                Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
